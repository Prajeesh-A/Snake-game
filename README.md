Here's a simple `README.md` template for a basic Nokia Snake Game:

```markdown
# Nokia Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Nokia Snake game using [programming language/framework you used]. This game is inspired by the original game that was preloaded on old Nokia phones, providing a nostalgic experience of the gameplay.

## Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics: control the snake, eat food, grow in length.
- Simple, retro-style graphics.
- Basic collision detection with walls and the snake itself.
- Increase in game difficulty as the snake grows longer.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Programming language/runtime] (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Any necessary dependencies (if applicable, like Pygame for Python or a web browser for JavaScript)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/nokia-snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nokia-snake-game
   ```

3. Install any dependencies if needed. For example, if you're using Python and Pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat food (appears as a small square or dot) to grow your snake.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

### How to Customize:
1. Replace `[programming language/framework you used]` with the actual language or framework (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.).
2. Add any specific instructions about dependencies, for example, if you used Pygame or a specific game library.
3. Modify the "How to Play" section to reflect any special mechanics or controls for your game.
